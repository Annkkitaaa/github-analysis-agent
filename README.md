## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- GitHub API token
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Annkkitaaa/github-analysis-agent.git
   cd github-analysis-agent
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your API credentials:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   REPOS=ethereum/go-ethereum,worldcoin/world-id-contracts
   ```

### Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

Or use the command-line interface:
```bash
python src/main.py
```
